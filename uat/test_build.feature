Feature: As a component builder, I can run `gdk test-e2e build` command to build the testing module using GDK config and command arguments.

    @version(min='1.3.0')
    @change_cwd
    Scenario: test-e2e-build-1: As a component builder, when I run the test-e2e build command, test feature files are updated and then the module is built.
        Given we have cli installed
        When we run gdk component init -t HelloWorld -l python -n HelloWorld
        Then command was successful
        And we change directory to HelloWorld
        And change component name to com.example.PythonHelloWorld
        And we verify gdk project files
        When we run gdk component build
        When we run gdk test-e2e init
        Then we verify gdk test files
        When we run gdk test-e2e build
        Then we verify the test build files

    @version(min='1.3.0')
    @change_cwd
    Scenario: test-e2e-build-2: As a component builder, when I run the test-e2e build command without building the component, the command exits with an error
        Given we have cli installed
        When we run gdk component init -t HelloWorld -l python -n HelloWorld
        Then command was successful
        And we change directory to HelloWorld
        And change component name to com.example.PythonHelloWorld
        And we verify gdk project files
        When we run gdk test-e2e init
        Then we verify gdk test files
        When we run gdk test-e2e build
        Then cli exited with error
